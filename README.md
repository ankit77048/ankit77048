Hi there 👋

Nice meeting you, I'm Ankit !


👋 Hi, I’m a 4th year B.Tech student at Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology, passionate about learning and building things with code.

🔭 I’m currently working on improving my programming skills and building small projects to strengthen my fundamentals.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly and learning-based projects related to Java, Java full stack, or problem solving.

🛠️ I’m looking for help with understanding real-world project structure, best coding practices, and interview preparation.

🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Data Structures & Algorithms, and full stack java developer.

⚡ Fun fact: I believe consistency matters more than talent, and I try to code a little every day.
